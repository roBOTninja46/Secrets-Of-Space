                    Chandrayaan-2: India's Orbiter-Lander-Rover Mission
                </div>
                Chandrayaan-2 was India's second mission to the moon, and was a follow-up mission from the Chandrayaan-1
                mission that assisted in confirming the presence of water/hydroxyl on the moon in 2009.<br>

                Chandrayaan-2 launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota, India, aboard a
                Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) rocket on July 22, 2019 and reached lunar orbit on Aug.
                19. During the Sept. 6 (Sept. 7 IST) moon landing attempt, ISRO officials lost contact with the Vikram
                moon lander as the probe was just 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) above the lunar surface. Officials have
                been unable to reach the lander since losing contact on Sept. 6. <br>

                Despite the apparent crash-landing of the lander, ISRO has confirmed that all the instruments on board
                the orbiter are working well. The current orbiter carries eight different instruments — and Indian
                scientists are already poring over some of the mission's very first science data. On Oct. 4, ISRO
                released photos the orbiter's High Resolution Camera took on Sept. 5 of a crater called Boguslawsky E,
                located near the lunar south pole.<br>

                The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan ("Mars-craft", from mangala, "Mars" and yāna,
                "craft, vehicle"), is a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November
                2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is India's first interplanetary mission and it
                made it the fourth space agency to achieve Mars orbit, after Roscosmos, NASA, and the European Space
                Agency. It made India the first Asian nation to reach Martian orbit and the first nation in the world to
                do so on its maiden attempt.<br>

                The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre
                (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at
                09:08 UTC on 5 November 2013. The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October
                2013. The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising
                orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC). After a 298-day transit to
                Mars, it was put into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.<br>

                The mission is a "technology demonstrator" project to develop the technologies for designing, planning,
                management, and operations of an interplanetary mission.[24] It carries five scientific instruments.[25]
                The spacecraft is currently being monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO Telemetry,
                Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru with support from the Indian Deep Space Network
                (IDSN) antennae at Bengaluru, Karnataka.<br>

                    Hope Mars Mission: UAE Becomes Fifth Nation to Successfully Enter the Orbit of Red Planet.
                </div>
                The United Arab Emirates (UAE) made history by successfully entering the orbit of the red planet on
                February 9. With this mission, named Hope Probe Mars mission, UAE's Space Agency became the fifth agency
                in the world to achieve the feat—after those from the US, the Soviet Union, Europe and India.<br>
                The spacecraft left for the journey to Mars in July 2020 and took approximately seven months to reach
                the red planet. The spacecraft went through a 27-minute burn phase of its main thrusters, which helped
                the probe to enter an initial capture orbit around Mars, at 10:57 a.m. Eastern time. As per reports, the
                ground-based team at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) received signals from the spacecraft
                after 11 minutes, which confirmed the successful orbital insertion of the probe.<br>
                Now, after successful entry, the UAE scientists and engineers will spend the next two months testing the
                spacecraft and its onboard scientific instruments before its final science orbit. In its capture orbit,
                Hope Probe's nearest point above Mars' surface is 1,000 km while its farthest point is 49,380 km. The
                probe will travel at altitudes ranging from 20,000 to 43,000 kilometers above the planet with an
                inclination of 25 degrees.<br>
                "During this stage, the ground control at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre in Dubai will conduct
                Three Transition to Science (TTS) manoeuvers to move the probe from its capture to science orbit by
                April," said Omran Ahmed Al Hammadi, head of the Science Data Centre for the probe. In this orbit, the
                spacecraft can complete one orbit of Mars every 55 hours and will capture a full planetary sample every
                nine days.<br>
                The main aim of the mission is to study the planet’s thin atmosphere. The other main goals include the
                study of the planet’s climate dynamics—how Mars loses hydrogen and oxygen from its atmosphere. The most
                ambitious goal is to create a global map of Mars’ atmosphere—the first by any nation in the world.<br>
                With its three scientific instruments, Hope Probe will map a complete portrait of the Martian atmosphere
                and study its seasonal and daily changes. Moreover, the spacecraft is expected to collect more than one
                terabyte (1,000 GB) of new data, which will be shared with over 200 academic and scientific institutions
                worldwide for free.<br>
                It’s the first interplanetary mission for the UAE space agency, which was announced back in 2014 with a
                cost of approximately $200m. The country is gearing up to start Mars settlement by 2117.<br>
                Hope was the first of three space missions sent toward the Red Planet during July 2020's Mars launch
                window. It was launched on July 19, 2020, onboard Japan's H-2A rocket from the Japanese space centre.
                The other two lander missions were launched by the premier space agencies of China (CNSA) and the US
                (NASA). The Chinese mission is named Tianwen-1, while the US mission is called the Perseverance
                Mission.<br>
                Indian Space Research Organisation became the fourth agency to reach Mars on September 24, 2014, through
                its historic Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan.<br>

                Ships of 300 tonnes or more on international voyages, cargo ships of 500 tonnes or more in local waters
                and all passenger ships irrespective of size are mandated by the International Maritime Organization to
                carry automatic identification system (AIS) equipment.<br>

                International AIS is the maritime equivalent of air traffic control. This radio-based communications
                system was originally developed to prevent collisions of large vessels. It transmits the course and
                speed as well as identification and position information to other vessels and shore stations.<br>

                While AIS has been deployed globally, it suffers from a major limitation because Earth’s curvature
                limits its horizontal range to about 74 km from shore. This means that AIS traffic information is
                available only around coastal zones or on a ship-to-ship basis.<br>

                Tracking ships using microsatellites (SAT-AIS) solves this problem. The ship’s identity, position, route
                and other information is recorded and decoded by satellite then sent to ground stations for further
                processing and distribution.<br>

                ESA is promoting SAT-AIS systems, technologies and services in partnership with the European Maritime
                Safety Agency, a regulatory agency established in the late 1990s, along with a number of other major
                European maritime safety initiatives. It supports the European Commission and Member States in maritime
                safety services, such as the prevention of pollution from ships and tracking of dangerous goods.<br>

                The ESAIL satellite developed in an ESA Partnership Project with the Canadian operator exactEarth is
                part of ESA's SAT-AIS programme. The satellite is built by LuxSpace with the support of the Luxembourg
                Space Agency and other ESA member states. ESA's Partnership Projects aim to develop sustainable
                end-to-end systems, right up to in-orbit validation.<br>

                ESAIL is due to be launched in summer 2020 on Arianespace first Vega rideshare flight from Europe’s
                spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. It will be launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of
                more than 500 km.<br>

                    BepiColombo
                </div>
                One of ESA’s cornerstone missions, it will study and understand the composition, geophysics, atmosphere,
                magnetosphere and history of Mercury, the least explored planet in the inner Solar System. It has been
                launched in 2018.<br>

                BepiColombo will provide the best understanding of Mercury to date. It consists of two individual
                orbiters: the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) to map the planet, and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter
                (MMO) to investigate its magnetosphere.<br>

                Most of ESA's previous interplanetary missions have been to relatively cold parts of the Solar System.
                BepiColombo will be the Agency's first experience of sending a planetary probe close to the Sun.<br>

                BepiColombo’s mission is especially challenging because Mercury's orbit is so close to our star. The
                planet is hard to observe from a distance, because the Sun is so bright. Furthermore, it is difficult to
                reach because a spacecraft must lose a lot of energy to ‘fall’ towards the planet from the Earth. The
                Sun’s enormous gravity presents a challenge in placing a spacecraft into a stable orbit around
                Mercury.<br>

                Only NASA's Mariner 10 and Messenger have visited Mercury so far. Mariner 10 provided the first-ever
                close-up images of the planet when it flew past three times in 1974-1975. En route to its final
                destination in orbit around Mercury in 18 March 2011, Messenger flew past the planet 3 times (14 January
                2008, 6 October 2008, and 29 September 2009), providing new data and images. Once BepiColombo arrives in
                late 2025, it will help reveal information on the composition and history of Mercury. It should discover
                more about the formation and the history of the inner planets in general, including Earth.<br>

                BepiColombo will use the gravity of Earth, Venus and Mercury in combination with the thrust provided by
                solar-electric propulsion (SEP). During the voyage to Mercury, the two orbiters and a transfer module,
                consisting of electric propulsion and traditional chemical rocket units, will form one single composite
                spacecraft.<br>

                When approaching Mercury in late 2025, the transfer module will be separated and the composite
                spacecraft will use rocket engines and a technique called 'weak stability boundary capture’ to bring it
                into polar orbit around the planet. When the MMO orbit is reached, the MPO will separate and lower its
                altitude to its own operational orbit. Observations from orbit will be taken for at least one Earth year
                with the possibility of an extension.<br>

                    UK and Australia to launch Space Bridge
                </div>
                The UK and Australia have signed a new ‘Space Bridge’ partnership to increase knowledge exchange and
                investment across the two countries’ space sectors.<br>
                A UK government announcement said the Space Bridge will unlock improved access to trade, investment and
                academic research opportunities, better advice to businesses and innovative bilateral
                collaborations.<br>
                The UK and Australia share future ambitions for space and have similar plans to increase the size and
                job creation potential of the sector. This agreement will further develop the longstanding relationship
                between the two countries, which dates back to the 1970s when the Prospero satellite built in
                Farnborough launched from Woomera, South Australia.<br>
                The arrangement enhances cooperation between the UK Space Agency, UK Department for International Trade,
                Australian Trade & Investment Commission, and the Australian Space Agency, coordinating opportunities
                for the UK and Australian governments and companies to work on space-related activities, including
                sharing Earth Observation data to collaborating on robotic and artificial intelligence.<br>
                “The signing of today’s Space Bridge partnership, a world’s first, with one of our closet international
                allies, is another step forward in our ambition for the UK to become a globally-competitive space
                power,” said UK Science Minister Amanda Solloway.<br>
                “The bond will allow our most innovative space businesses and universities to collaborate and share best
                practice more effectively than ever. I’m excited to see how this partnership will unlock new space jobs
                in both countries while driving forward new ideas that could enrich all of our lives.”<br>
                The UK boasts strong foreign direct investment levels into its space sector while the Australian space
                sector is said to have a strong appetite to expand operations into the UK.<br>
                “As the UK extends its ambitions in space, it’s only right that we forge new and stronger alliances with
                new and existing partners all across the globe,” said Dr Graham Turnock, CEO of the UK Space Agency.<br>
                “This agreement has the potential to unleash innovation, promote knowledge exchange and build
                relationships that will help both the UK and Australia maximise the vast economic and scientific
                potential that the space sector offers. It will help create better opportunities and greater security
                for people in both nations.”<br>
                Enrico Palermo, head of the Australian Space Agency, said: “The Space Bridge Framework Arrangement will
                help propel the Australian civil space industry into its next phase of growth, opening doors to build
                local capability, as well as significantly boost our collaboration with the UK Space Agency.”<br>
                The space sector is one of the fastest-growing UK sectors with 30,000 new jobs expected by 2030. The
                Australian space sector is also growing with up to 20,000 new Australian jobs expected by 2030.<br>

                Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE; in English, National Space Activities Commission) is
                the civilian agency of the government of Argentina in charge of the national space programme.<br>
                During the 1940s, Teófilo Tabanera organized a group of foreign and Argentine specialists as the
                Sociedad Argentina Interplanetaria, SAI (Argentine Interplanetary Society). Tabanera's efforts ensured
                that Argentina was the first Latin American nation to create a spaceflight organisation and in 1952 was
                one of the founding members of the International Astronautical Federation. Argentine Aldo Cocca was a
                pioneer in space law and helped originate the idea of space being the common heritage of humankind,
                later enshrined in United Nations treaties of the 1960s.<br>
                In 1960, Tabanera was named head of the newly created Comisión Nacional de Investigaciones Espaciales
                CNIE (National Commission for Space Research), a forerunner agency founded in 1960.<br>
                CNIE worked with the Argentine Air Force's Instituto de Investigaciones Aeronáuticas y Espaciales (IIAE)
                to develop a number of indigenous multistage high-altitude sounding rockets and missiles. Argentina was
                the first country in Latin America to send an object into space using an indigenously-developed
                rocket.<br>
                During the 1970s, Argentina regularly launched the American two-stage solid-propellant Castor rocket up
                to 500 kilometers altitude. This rocket carried international experiments for several countries.<br>
                n the 1980s, Argentina took part in a multinational effort to develop the Condor missile. Under United
                States pressure, the Condor program was cancelled in 1991. The associated development and production
                facilities at Falda del Carmen were closed down, the Fabrica Militar de Aviones, which concentrated on
                development of surveillance satellites for Earth resource and environmental monitoring.<br>
                The present commission (CONAE) was created on 28 May 1991 during the government of Carlos Menem, after
                the cancellation of the military Condor missile program in an attempt to move all the commission efforts
                to civilian purposes. It received the Air Force aerospace facilities in Córdoba and Buenos Aires of the
                former CNIE, as well as some of the civil personnel involved in the cancelled project.<br>
                Since the 1990s the new commission signed agreements with NASA and European agencies and has developed a
                number of Earth Observation satellites, including SAC-A, the failed mission SAC-B, and the SAC-C
                launched in 2000 and still operating.<br>
                The administration of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner renationalised Fabrica Militar de Aviones in 2009
                and the Falda del Carmen facility has been reactivated to support the development of the new Tronador II
                rocket. Defense missile and rocket development has been restarted under the umbrella of CITEFA.<br>

                </div>
                On April 25, 2014, Airbus Defence and Space, a division of the Airbus Group, announced that it had been
                selected as sole prime contractor to develop, construct and launch the first Earth observation optical
                satellite system for Peru, with the support of the French government. The Peruvian Earth observation
                satellite system comprises a new-generation optical satellite and a ground control segment, referred to
                as CNOIS (Centro Nacional de Operaciones de Imágenes Satelitales del Peru), hosting the ground control
                segment for image reception and processing developed by Airbus Defence and Space.<br>
                Under the PeruSat-1 program (also spelled as PerúSAT-1), Airbus Defence and Space will also offer
                training for Peruvian engineers and technicians on the advanced instruction in space technologies,
                satellite operation, development of appropriate imaging applications, and other technologies. The
                company will download information and images from its fleet of optical and radar satellites and supply
                them to Peru.<br>
                The system includes a latest-generation optical satellite with its very high-resolution instrument (from
                the NAOMI (New AstroSat Optical Modular Instrument) family, combining the company's very best expertise
                in optical instrumentation).<br>
                With PeruSat-1, the Peruvian Defence Ministry becomes the launch customer for the AstroBus-S range,
                which uses technologies that combine performance and speed of construction. The reliability of this
                platform is the result of the expertise acquired through the development of more complex variants, on
                missions as diverse as optical imaging (Pleiades, SPOT -6 & - 7, Ingenio, KazEOSat-1), environmental
                monitoring (Sentinel-2) and meteorology (Sentinel-5P).<br>
                PeruSat-1 is also the first program run by the Projects Factory, a new and more integrated working
                organization in the Space System business unit. This new way of working brings down development and
                construction lead times for satellites up to 500 kg and optimizes their costs, without impacting quality
                in any way.<br>
                PeruSat-1 will also benefit from the experience gained with the NAOMI family of optical instruments from
                Airbus DS. This technology is state of the art in all fields (performance, lead times, etc.) thanks to
                the use of appropriate technologies: silicon carbide (SiC) optics and structures, multiple-line
                detectors, integrated focal planes and ultra-compact optical configurations. Airbus DS has used these
                technologies on Earth observation satellites and complex scientific telescopes already in operation
                (e.g. Herschel, Gaia, KazEOSat-1), and on the Rosetta comet probe.<br>
                The first instantiation of the Astrobus S platform is developed for PeruSat-1 satellite in a very short
                planning of about 2 years thanks to extensive reuse allowed by the Astrobus product line family with
                AS250 avionics. This instantiation will take advantage of some equipment developed through the Myriade
                Evolutions initiative and be available in time.<br>
                The Astrobus S platform will continue using the core Avionics and will evolve taking benefit of the
                Myriade Evolutions equipment, offering increased capabilities for the payload in terms of mass and
                power. The Astrobus S platform adopts the new structure and the new adapted propulsion system, both
                sub-contracted to Airbus Defence and Space, and most of the avionics new units, as Solar Array, Battery,
                PCDU (Power Control and Distribution Unit) and others. The AstroBus-S platform is the latest generation
                of high-end satellites designed for a 10-year lifetime<br>
                June 6, 2016: Airbus Defence and Space has completed integration of PeruSat-1, Peru's first Earth
                observation satellite. It was built in less than 24 months. PeruSat-1 was ordered by the Peruvian
                government for its national space agency, CONIDA (Comisión Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo
                Aeroespacial), in 2014. PeruSat-1, based on the highly flexible, compact AstroBus-S platform, will
                observe Earth via a revolutionary silicon carbide optical instrument system at 70 cm spatial
                resolution.<br>
                PeruSat-1 proves that a powerful and sophisticated Earth observation satellite can be built in less than
                two years. AIT (Assembly Integration and Test) of the instrument was completed in about eight months,
                with the platform construction phase, satellite construction, and technical and operational system
                validation taking only five months each, respectively.<br>
                The PeruSat-1 minisatellite of the Peruvian Armed Forces with a liftoff mass of ~ 430 kg was launched on
                Sept. 16, 2016 (01:43:35 UTC) on a Vega vehicle (designated as VV07) of Arianespace from Kourou, French
                Guinea.<br>
                March 16, 2018: Since the satellite started operations in December 2016, PerúSAT-1 has acquired more
                than 102,200 images that have been used by more than 70 public entities registered at the CNOIS
                (National Satellite Image Operation Center) up to date.<br>
                December 14, 2017: PeruSat-1 (also written as PerúSAT-1) has completed its first year of operation and
                the Peruvian government has recently declared that in that time, the investment it has made into the
                satellite program has already been recouped.<br>

                TKSAT 1, named after a national hero, Tupac Katari, is be the first communications satellite of Bolivia.
                It provides communications and broadcasting services to the whole territory of Bolivia and the
                surrounding areas, and facilitate the development of civil projects like remote education and
                telemedicine. The DFH-4 based satellite has an expected service life of 15 years. TKSAT 1 has 26
                Ku-band, 2 C-band and 2 Ka-band transponders on board.<br>
                it was launched into orbit on 20 December 2013 from the Satellite Launch Center in Xichang, China,
                with a trial period of a little over three months, and commercial operation starting in March 2014.<br>
                it was built on behalf of the Bolivian Space Agency. The China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC),
                a subsidiary of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), was responsible for the
                construction (using French, German and USA technology), launch and orbit of the satellite.<br>
                The satellite is named after 18th century Bolivian independence activist Túpac Katari.<br>
                The satellite is geostationary and parked at 87.2° W, at a distance of 36,000 kilometers from
                Ecuador; two-way voice communications are subject to latency.The estimated useful life is 15 years;
                having been launched in 2013, it should be deactivated in
                2028, or −7 years and 301 days from now.<br>
                The satellite had a cost of around $300 million, of which $251 million was a loan from the China
                Development Bank (CDB) to the government of Bolivia, and the rest was paid by the government of
                Bolivia.From launch to August 2017, the satellite generated revenue of $60 million. The Bolivian Space
                Agency said the satellite was not a business, but instead its purpose was to increase access to
                communications. Running expenses were not disclosed<br>

                    Interplanetary Superhighway Makes Space Travel Simpler<br>
                </div>
                A "freeway" through the solar system resembling a vast array of virtual winding tunnels and conduits
                around
                the
                Sun and planets, as envisioned by an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., can
                slash
                the amount of fuel needed for future space missions.<br>
                Called the Interplanetary Superhighway, the system was conceived by Martin Lo, whose software was used
                to
                help
                design the flight path for NASA's Genesis mission, which is currently using this "freeway in space" on
                its
                mission to collect solar wind particles for return to Earth.<br>
                Most missions are designed to take advantage of the way gravity pulls on a spacecraft when it swings by
                a
                body
                such as a planet or moon. Lo's concept takes advantage of another factor, the Sun's pull on the planets
                or a
                planet's pull on its nearby moons. Forces from many directions nearly cancel each other out, leaving
                paths
                through the gravity fields in which spacecraft can travel.<br>
                Each planet and moon has five locations in space called Lagrange points, where one body's gravity
                balances
                another's. Spacecraft can orbit there while burning very little fuel. To find the Interplanetary
                Superhighway,
                Lo mapped some possible flight paths among the Lagrange points, varying the distance the spacecraft
                would go
                and
                how fast or slow it would travel. Like threads twisted together to form a rope, the possible flight
                paths
                formed
                tubes in space. Lo plans to map out these tubes for the whole solar system.<br>
                Lo's research is based on theoretical work begun in the late nineteenth century by the French
                mathematician
                Henri Poincaré. In 1978, NASA's International Sun-Earth Explorer 3 was the first mission to use low
                energy
                orbits around a Lagrange point. Later, using low energy paths between Earth and the Moon, controllers at
                NASA's
                Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., sent the spacecraft to the first encounter with a comet,
                Comet
                Giacobini-Zinner, in 1985.<br>
                In 1991, another method of analyzing low energy orbits was used by engineers from JPL and the Japanese
                Space
                Agency to enable the Japanese Hiten mission to reach the Moon. Inspired by this pioneering work and
                research
                conducted by scientists at the University of Barcelona, Lo conceived the theory of the Interplanetary
                Superhighway.<br>
                Lo and his colleagues have turned the underlying mathematics of the Interplanetary Superhighway into a
                tool
                for
                mission design called "LTool," using models and algorithms developed at Purdue University, West
                Lafayette,
                Ind.
                The new LTool was used by JPL engineers to redesign the flight path for the Genesis mission to adapt to
                a
                change
                in launch dates. Genesis launched in August 2001.<br>
                The flight path was designed for the spacecraft to leave Earth and travel to orbit the Lagrange point.
                After
                five loops around this Lagrange point, the spacecraft will fall out of orbit without any maneuvers and
                then
                pass
                by Earth to a Lagrange point on the opposite side of the planet. Finally, it will return to Earth's
                upper
                atmosphere to drop off its samples of solar wind in the Utah desert.<br>
                "Genesis wouldn't need to use any fuel at all in a perfect world," Lo said. "But since we can't control
                the
                many
                variables that occur throughout the mission, we have to make some corrections as Genesis completes its
                loops
                around a Lagrange point of Earth. The savings on the fuel translates into a better and cheaper
                mission."<br>
                Lo added, "This concept does not guarantee easy access to every part of the solar system. However, I can
                envision a place where we might construct and service science platforms around one of the Moon's
                Lagrange
                points. Since Lagrange points are landmarks for the Interplanetary Superhighway, we might be able to
                shunt
                spacecraft to and from such platforms." A team at NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, working with the
                NASA
                Exploration Team, proposes to someday use the Interplanetary Superhighway for future human space
                missions.<br>
                "Lo's work has led to breakthroughs in simplifying mission concepts for human and robotic exploration
                beyond
                low-Earth orbit," said Doug Cooke, manager of Johnson's Advanced Development Office. "These
                simplifications
                result in fewer space vehicles needed for a broad range of mission options."<br>
                The work on the Interplanetary Superhighway for space mission design was nominated for a Discover
                Innovation
                Award by Discover magazine editors and an outside panel of experts.<br>

                </div>
                <div class="aritcle_h">Top 20 facts on "Perseverance Rover"</div>
                1. The name Perseverance was chosen by a seventh grader named Alexander Mather, who won a nationwide
                contest
                held by NASA to name the 2020 rover.<br>
                2. Perseverance needs to take off within the launch window of July 30-August 15, otherwise, NASA will
                have
                to
                wait until September 2022 to try again.<br>
                3. Perseverance is currently the only mission with "orbital constraint," meaning that its launch to Mars
                depends on planetary alignment between Earth and Mars, which takes place during three crucial weeks
                every 26
                months.<br>
                4. Although it is launching in the summer, Perseverance will make the 64-million-mile journey to Mars in
                about
                six months and will land on the Red Planet in February 2021.<br>
                5. NASA previously sent three rovers to Mars, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity, which landed on Mars
                in
                2012
                and is still roaming the Red Planet till today.<br>
                6. Around 90 percent of the team behind Perseverance started working from home earlier in March in
                response
                to
                the spread of the novel coronavirus, which makes the Mars 2020 mission the only one to go through final
                prep
                with a virtual remote team.<br>
                7. Perseverance's destination is the Jezero Crater, a 500-meter-deep crater located in a basin slightly
                north
                of the Martian equator.<br>
                8. Jezero Crater once housed a lake estimated to have dried out 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. Therefore,
                it
                is
                the ideal location for Perseverance to hunt for signs of past microbial life.<br>
                9. The mission will also test out conditions for possible human exploration of Mars by trialing a method
                of
                producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, characterizing environmental conditions such as water and
                dust
                on Mars, and looking for resources.<br>
                10. The entry and landing of the Perseverance rover on Mars is referred to as the, 'seven minutes of
                terror.'
                That's how long it takes for the rover to get from the top of the Martian atmosphere and down to the
                surface.<br>
                11. It then takes an additional 14 minutes for the team to receive a signal from the rover on Mars,
                considering
                there's a lag since Mars is millions of miles away.<br>
                12. Once on Mars, the team will communicate with Perseverance via the Deep Space Network, a global
                network
                of
                antennas that were built in the 1960's.<br>
                13. The Perseverance rover will collect at least 20 samples from Mars using a handy drill, literally
                attached to
                the robot's arm.<br>
                14. The rock samples will be stored away in tubes in a well-identified place on the Martian surface, and
                left
                there to be returned to Earth by a future sample return mission to the Red Planet.<br>
                15. Perseverance isn't venturing to Mars on its own. The Ingenuity helicopter will hitch a ride with the
                rover,
                and allow NASA to test out its ability to fly a helicopter on a planet other than Earth for the first
                time.<br>
                16. The team behind Perseverance redesigned its wheels, giving the rover narrower wheels than its
                predecessor
                Curiosity, but bigger in diameter and made of thicker aluminum in order to handle the wear and tear of
                driving around the Martian terrain.<br>
                17. Perseverance will carry a highly skilled team of detectives on board, its instruments S.H.E.R.L.O.C
                ,
                (Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals) and WATSON, Wide
                Angle
                Topographic Sensor for Operations and eNgineering instrument, will look for microscopic clues in Martian
                rock.<br>
                18. The Perseverance mission feature 23 cameras, more cameras than any other interplanetary mission in
                history.<br>
                19. The names of 10,932,295 people were etched onto Perseverance as part of NASA's "Send Your Name to
                Mars"
                campaign.<br>
                20. Perseverance rover is set to spend at least one Martian year on the planet — the equivalent of 687
                days
                on
                Earth.

                    Scientists discover a 'new Earth' after digging through data that A.I. missed.
                </div>
                In October 2018, NASA's Kepler space telescope ran out of fuel after nine years of surveying the wider
                cosmos, looking for alien worlds. During its mission, Kepler discovered more than 2,600 weird and
                exciting exoplanets.<br>
                Two years after retirement, Kepler is the mission that keeps on giving. Scientists re-examining old
                Kepler data have discovered an exoplanet that is the closest to Earth in terms of size and temperature
                and orbits within its star's habitable zone.<br>
                The discovery, announced this month, inches us closer to finding habitability outside of the Solar
                System.<br>
                The discovery was detailed in a paper published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal Letters.<br>
                The newly discovered exoplanet, dubbed Kepler-1649c, is about the same size as Earth, only 1.06 times
                larger than our own planet, and may have similar temperatures as it receives 75% of the amount of light
                that Earth receives from the Sun.<br>
                <div class="ram">
                    <img src="a9ec7302-fc9d-43ff-8e09-60aae9d1b65c-pia23774-16.jpg" alt="Kepler-1649c" class="nahi">
                </div>
                Out of the approximately 4,000 exoplanets that we have discovered thus far, some have been closer to the
                size of Earth, while others had more similar temperatures. However, none have been this close to Earth
                in
                regards to both of those values, in addition to orbiting in its star's habitable zone, or the range of
                orbit
                around a star where a planet can support liquid water.<br>

                other projects to provide assessment on flooding, fires, resource management and environmental phenomena
                in South Africa and the African continent.<br>
                SANSA was formed after an act of parliament was passed by acting President Kgalema Motlanthe in 2009.
                The agency was formed with the intent of consolidating space-related research, projects and research in
                South Africa and to assume the role as a regional center for space research in Africa.<br>
                Throughout the 1950s to 1970s lunar and interplanetary missions conducted by NASA had been supported
                from a tracking station at Hartebeesthoek where the first images of Mars were received from the Mariner
                IV spacecraft in the first successful flyby of the planet.[6] Other South African facilities also
                assisted in tracking satellites to determine the effects of the upper atmosphere on their orbits.<br>
                In 1980s work on the development of a launcher and a satellite had been in progress but was discontinued
                after 1994. In 1999, South Africa launched its first satellite, SUNSAT from Vandenberg Air Force Base in
                the US. A second satellite, SumbandilaSat, was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in
                2009.<br>
                Currently, SANSA's main focusses include using data obtained from remote sensing through satellites and
                other projects to provide assessment on flooding, fires, resource management and environmental phenomena
                in South Africa and the African continent.<br>
