                Facts and Information About the Solar System
            </div>
            When we talk about the Solar System, we realise that we are nothing but a speck of dust in the universe. Do
            you look up in the night sky and wonder what is out there? If you do, then you are probably interested in
            knowing all that you can about the Solar System. The sun, the planets, and countless smaller bodies
            fascinate us. If you want to know more about them, read on.<br>
            <div class="article_h_sub">
                What is the Solar System?
            </div>
            Our solar system is made up of the sun, the eight planets that orbit the sun, and the countless smaller
            bodies such as asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets. The sun which lights up everything is actually a star
            and everything orbiting it is is bound by gravity. There are eight planets that orbit the sun namely,
            Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto which was the ninth planet has now
            been classified as a dwarf planet along with other dwarf planets like Eris, Ceres, Makemake, and Haumea.<br>

                Facts About the Solar System for Children
            </div>
            Here are some interesting facts about the solar system that you children should know.
            <div class="article_h_deep">
                1. The sun is far away from the Earth.
            </div>
            The distance between the sun and the Earth is about 150 million kilometres. The light from the sun
            travelling at a speed of 300,000 Km takes about 8 minutes to reach us. To help your kids understand better,
            here is an example they would like – If you decide to drive to the sun by your car at a speed of 100km/hr,
            it would take you a little over 171 years to get to the sun.<br>
            <div class="article_h_deep">
                2. Years ago, people thought that Earth was the centre of the universe.
            </div>
            For thousands of years, people believed that the Earth was the centre of the universe and that the sun,
            planets, and stars orbited the Earth. But astronomers like Galileo and Copernicus showed otherwise by
            developing a model that explained the movement of the planets around the sun.<br>
            <div class="article_h_deep">
                3. Most of the Solar System’s mass is contained in the sun.
            </div>
            The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass of the solar system, followed by the planets Jupiter and Saturn. The
            rest of the planets and asteroids make up a very small percentage of the Solar System’s Mass.<br>
            <div class="article_h_deep">
                4. The inner planets are composed of rocks and metals.
            </div>
            The four inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are smaller and are mainly composed of rocky matter
            and metals. They are also called terrestrial planets.<br>
            <div class="article_h_deep">
                5. The outer planets are composed of gases.
            </div>
            The outer planets of the Solar System—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—are mostly made up of gases such
            as hydrogen and helium. These planets are also called ‘gas giants’.<br>
            <div class="ram">

                6. Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System.
            </div>
            Jupiter, the gas giant, has a diameter of 142,984 km. It has dozens of moons and a Giant Red Spot, which is
            a planetary storm that runs across it.<br>
            <div class="article_h_deep">
                7. Saturn’s rings are beautiful.
            </div>
            Although Saturn’s rings are can be seen through telescopes. The rings are around 30 ft in thickness.
            However, some parts are several kilometres thick and are mostly made of dusty ice and debris.<br>
            <div class="article_h_deep">
                8. The sun is a hot ball of gas.
            </div>
            The sun is a massive ball of hot and dense gases, mainly hydrogen and helium. It has a surface temperature
            of 5,500 degrees Celsius. It is about 5 billion years old and is expected to last 5 more billion years.<br>
            <div class="article_h_deep">
                9. Venus is the hottest planet in our Solar System.
            </div>
            Although Mercury is closest to the sun, the presence of thick carbon dioxide makes Venus the hottest planet
            in the solar system. The average surface temperature of Venus is 477°C.<br>
            <div class="article_h_deep">
                10. The asteroid belt is made up of rocks.

                Mercury
            </div>
            Mercury is named after the Roman god of commerce, travel, and thievery. In Greek mythology, Mercury was
            known as Hermes, the messenger of the gods. It probably received this name because it moves very quickly
            across the sky.<br>

                Key Facts & Summary

            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun at a distance of 57 million kilometers / 35 million miles.
                </li>
                <li>Out of all the terrestrial planets, Mercury is the smallest. It is also the smallest planet in the
                    Solar System.</li>
                <li>Despite being so small, Mercury is the second-densest planet in the Solar System after Earth. This
                    means it is very compact.</li>
                <li>Mercury does not have any satellites or ring systems.</li>
                <li>The surface of Mercury is similar to the Moon. It is the most heavily cratered planet and this means
                    that it hasn’t been geologically active for many years.</li>
                <li>Mercury has a radius of 2.439 km / 1.516 mi and a diameter of 4.879 km / 3.032 mi.</li>
                <li>Though it is the closest planet to the Sun, temperatures on Mercury are both hot and cold.</li>
                <li>During the day, Mercury’s average surface temperatures can reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit / 430
                    degrees Celsius.</li>
                <li>At night, Mercury’s surface temperatures can drop to as low as -290 degrees Fahrenheit / -180
                    degrees Celsius.</li>
                <li>Mercury’s changes in temperature are the most drastic in the Solar System.</li>
                <li>Mercury formed around 4.5 billion years ago after gravity pulled swirling gases and dust together.
                </li>
                <li>After Mercury was formed, scientists believe that it suffered heavy bombardments by comets and
                    asteroids shortly after. Another event called the Late Heavy Bombardment which ended around 3.8
                    billion years ago, may also be responsible for Mercury’s cratered surface.</li>
                <li>Almost 85% of Mercury’s radius is represented by its enormous iron core.</li>
                <li>Due to the core’s unusual size, Mercury began to shrink as the core cooled and contracted pulling
                    the surface inward.</li>
            </ul><br>
            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun. Though it is very
            close to the Sun, it is not the hottest planet, that title belongs to Venus, but Mercury is the
            second-hottest nonetheless.<br>
            Mercury is slightly bigger than Earth’s Moon, and it is also very similar in appearance to our Moon. Mercury
            itself doesn’t have any moons. The planet can be seen without binoculars or telescopes, but since it is so
            near to the Sun, it may be hard to see in the early evening skies.<br>
            <div class="article_h_sub">
                Surface and structure
            </div>
            Mercury is covered with craters from various impacts. One of the largest is called the Caloris Basin, and it
            is 1.300 kilometers / 807 miles across.<br>
            <div class="ram">
                <img src="crater.jpg" alt="crater" class="nahi">
            </div>
            It was probably created by a big impact long ago. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere called an exosphere. It
            is made out of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.<br>
            Since its surface is similar to our Moon, it indicates that the small planet hasn’t been geologically active
            for many years. The planet is primarily made out of rocks.<br>
            Though it is very hot on Mercury, frozen water exists on its surface. Some of the deep craters present at
            the poles are never exposed to direct sunlight, and temperatures remain very low there.<br>

            The planet Venus is named after the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty. In Greek mythology, she is
            known as Aphrodite. The planet was named after this goddess because, for the ancient people, it shinned the
            brightest.<Br>

                <li>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth-largest planet in the Solar System.</li>
                <li>Venus and Mercury are the only planets in the Solar System that do not have a moon.</li>
                <li>Venus is the second brightest object in the sky after the Moon, and the Sun.</li>
                <li>It is the only planet named after a female deity and the brightest planet in the Solar System</li>
                <li>Venus is 62 degrees hotter than Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun.</li>
                <li>Venus has a radius of 6.051 kilometers / 3.760 miles, and a diameter of 12.104 km / 7.521 mi. It is
                    only slightly smaller than Earth.</li>
                <li>Venus is at a distance of 108 million km / 68 million mi away from the Sun.</li>
                <li>One day on Venus lasts for about 243 Earth days. This is the slowest rotation of any planet making
                    it the most spherical object in the Solar System, after the Sun.</li>
                <li>Venus and Uranus rotate in the opposite direction than the other planets. They both move from East
                    to West, clockwise.</li>
                <li>Venus has montains, valleys, and tens of thousands of volcanoes. The highest mountain on Venus,
                    Maxwell Montes, is 20,000 feet / 8.8 kilometers high – very similar to the highest mountain on
                    Earth, Everest.</li>
                <li>Apart from lacking any moons, Venus also doesn’t have a ring system, and because it rotates very
                    slowly, its magnetosphere is also very weak.</li>
                <li>The average temperatures on Venus have been estimated to be at around 465 degrees Celsius / 900
                    degrees Fahrenheit, this is hot enough to melt lead.</li>
            </ul><br>
            In our Solar System, the planet closest to the Sun is Mercury. But even though it is the nearest, it isn’t
            the hottest planet. Venus is actually the hottest planet out of all the planets in the Solar System.<br>
            But how can this be? Well, Venus has gases and clouds of sulfuric acid that traps the heat and keeps Venus
            toasty warm. It is so hot on Venus, that even metals would melt and become liquid.<br>
            <div class="article_h_sub">
                Surface and structure

            Venus is a little smaller than Earth, but like our planet, it has mountains, volcanoes, and few craters that
            indicate a relatively young surface. Both worlds also have similar densities and chemical compositions.<br>
            Venus is sometimes referred to as Earth’s sister since scientists believe that it once had large amounts of
            water; however, it boiled away due to high temperatures.<br>
            This might have also happened to our planet if it was closer to the Sun. Venus is quite special since it
            spins in the opposite direction of most other planets, including Earth.<br>
            <div class="ram">

            Most of Venus’s surface consists of gently rolling plains. Mountains and hills are rare. Much of the surface
            is covered by lava flows. In fact, there are plenty of large volcanoes like the ones in Hawaii on Venus.<br>
            One of the largest volcanoes on Venus is Sif Mons. The interesting fact is that Venus has many active
            volcanoes on its surface to this day.<br>

                <li>The name Earth is at least 1.000 years old. It simply translates to “the ground”. The Greek name for
                    Earth was Gaia – Mother Earth.
                    Only 3% of Earth’s water is fresh and 97% of it is salty.</li>
                <li>The surface of Earth is covered by water, around 71%, only 29% of Earth’s surface is covered by
                    land.</li>
                <li>The mixture of gases commonly known as air are nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide. Without

                <li>The atmosphere of Earth is divided into 6 layers – the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere,
                    thermosphere, exosphere, and ionosphere.</li>
                <li>Earth has the greatest density out of all the planets in our Solar System. This means it is very

            Studying our Earth both with and without the aid of a spacecraft can help us understand just how life
            developed here and not someplace else.<br>
            It was not until the twentieth century that we had maps of the entire planet. Every picture taken from space
            of our world is very important since they help in predicting the weather, especially in tracking and
            predicting hurricanes.<br>

                Surface and Structure
            </div>
            The surface of the Earth is very young – this means that the surface changed a lot from when it was first
            formed. Erosion and tectonic processes, like earthquakes, for example, destroy, recreate, and reshape most
            of Earth’s surface.<br>
            Earth is currently the only known planet where water can exist in liquid form on the surface. Most of our
            planet is covered by water, around 71%. The vast oceans keep the temperatures on Earth stable, and this is
            crucial in the maintaining of life. Water is essential for life, at least the way we know it.<br>
            Water is also responsible for most of the erosion and weathering of the Earth’s continents, a process which
            is unique in our Solar System. Our Earth has four major main layers: an inner core at the center, an outer
            core enveloping it, the mantle, and the crust.<br>

                <li>The tallest volcano/mountain in the Solar System is located on Mars. It is named Olympus Mons and it
                    seems to have a height of 21 km / 13 mi.</li>
                <li>Mars also has the biggest canyon in the Solar System. It is named Valles Marines. It is 4.000 km /

            Mars is widely known as the Red planet. Its reddish appearance is caused by the presence of rusty iron in
            the ground. The name of the month March is derived from Mars.<br>
            Mars is visible to the naked eye, and as such, you can see it without the use of a telescope or binoculars.
            The Red planet is very similar to Earth, and scientists are trying to find out if life was present
            there.<br>
            <div class="article_h_sub">
                Surface and Structure
            </div>
            In many ways, Mars can be considered Earth’s brother. It has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons,
            and weather. There are many signs of ancient floods on the Red Planet, but now water mostly exists in icy
            dirt and thin clouds.<br>
            There is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground, especially on hillsides. This may be great if people
            will go there in the future, but observations continue.<br>
            Mars is the seventh-largest planet of the Solar System and the fourth planet from the Sun. It has the most
            varied and complex terrain than any of the terrestrial planets, except for Earth.<br>
            On Mars’s surface, we have discovered the biggest mountain in the Solar System. It is named Olympus Mons,
            and it is three times bigger than the largest mountain on Earth, Everest.<br>

            Another great feature of Mars is Valles Marineris, a network of canyons that run 4.000 km / 2.485 mi long
            and stand from 2 to 7 km / 1 to 4 mi tall.<br>
            Hellas Planitia is a huge crater on Mars created from an ancient impact. It is located on the Red Planet’s
            southern hemisphere and its over 6 km / 3.7 mi deep and 2.000 km / 1.242 mi across.<br>
            Oceans and lakes may have existed on Mars long ago, but it seems that water was only around for a short
            period. Some believe that water exists underneath Mars’s surface.<br>
            There are many differences in Mars’s southern and northern hemispheres. For example, in the southern
            hemisphere, many ancient cratered highlands are present, similar to the ones on the Moon.<br>
            In the northern hemisphere, plains have undergone changes since the planet formed long ago, and this
            hemisphere is also lower in elevation.<br>

                <li>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the biggest planet of our Solar System. Some consider
                    it a failed star since it is made out of swirling gases and liquids such as 90% hydrogen, and 10%
                    helium – very similar to the Sun.</li>
                <li>Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the sky and one of the five visible planets ( Mercury,
                    Venus, Mars, Saturn ).</li>
                <li>The envelope of gases – atmosphere – surrounding Jupiter is the largest planetary atmosphere in the

                    its atmosphere reaching altitudes of 5.000 km / 1.864 mi.</li>
                <li>Through the observations of Jupiter, the discovery of the four Galilean moons ended the belief that
                    everything revolved around the Earth.</li>
                <li>Jupiter has a total of 79 confirmed moons. It is second only to Saturn when it comes to the total
                    amount of satellites.</li>
                <li>Jupiter also has 3 ring systems but much smaller than Saturn’s.

                    massive than Earth.</li>
                <li>Jupiter is on average about 5.2 AU away from the Sun. One AU is equivalent to 150 million km / 93
                    million mi.</li>
                <li>Jupiter experiences 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.</li>
                <li>In a way, Jupiter is the Solar System’s vacuum cleaner, because of its powerful gravity which

            </ul><br>
            Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet of the Solar System. It is more than twice
            as massive as all the other planets combined, being 318 times bigger than Earth.<br>
            The planet is very similar to a star, but it never got big enough to start burning. Jupiter has rings
            surrounding it, but they are very faint and hard to see.<br>
            It is the planet with the second-most moons, 79, after Saturn, who has 82. The closest planets to Jupiter
            are Mars and Saturn. The planet can be seen with the naked eye, you don’t need a telescope or a pair of

            Jupiter is a gas giant, just like Saturn. It is made mostly out of hydrogen and helium. It doesn’t have a
            true surface, but it may have a solid core about the size of Earth at its center.<br>
            Jupiter is covered in swirling cloud stripes and has enormous storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been
            going on for hundreds of years.<br>

            The atmosphere is very thick, and it is made out of ammonia, sulfur, methane, and water vapor. Jupiter’s

            </ul><br>
            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in the Solar System after Jupiter.
            Saturn is the king of the moons because it has the most moons out of any planet, 82, and it may have even
            more.<br>
            Though it is the most distant of the visible planets – planets that can be seen without the need of a
            telescope or binoculars – a striking feature has always been noted, its rings.<br>
            Saturn is nicknamed the “Ringed Planet” – it has more than 30 ring systems around it. It isn’t the only
            planet with rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful and visible ones.<br>
            The first person to observe Saturn through a telescope was Galileo Galilei in the 1600s. Galileo wasn’t sure
            of what he was seeing, and at first thought the planet had handles, and then he believed he observed three

            The rings of Saturn are made out of chunks of ice and rock. Their exact origin is unknown. These rings are
            very bright and are composed of many small particles that circle Saturn at their own speeds.<br>>
            These objects range in size from a centime to several meters, and some few are kilometer-sized<br>
            Saturn itself is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium, and this is why it is known as a gas giant like

            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third largest of all the planets in our Solar System. Both

            Jupiter and Saturn.<br>
            Both Uranus and Neptune are blue because they have methane. Uranus is larger in size than Neptune but it is
            smaller in weight. It has thirteen ring systems and 23 confirmed moons<br>

                <li>Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun at an average distance of 4.5 billion kilometers / 2.8
                    billion miles.</li>
                <li>Neptune is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System and the smallest of the gas giants.</li>
                <li>Both Neptune and Uranus are termed ice giants since they have different compositions than Saturn and
                    Jupiter.</li>
                <li>Neptune has a radius of 24.764 km / 15.387 mi, and a diameter of 49.244 km / 30.598 mi.</li>
                <li>The core of Neptune is about 1.5 times the size of Earth.</li>
                <li>Wind speeds on Neptune are among the fastest recorded in the Solar System. Some may reach up to
                    2.160 km / 1.324 mi per hour. They are five times stronger than the strongest winds on Earth.</li>
                <li>Neptune’s average surface temperatures are around -214 degrees Celsius / -353 degrees Fahrenheit.
                </li>
                <li>Neptune has a total of 6 ring systems surrounding it. Some of them contain ring arcs or clusters of
                    dust particles.</li>
                <li>Neptune also has 14 moons. The largest moon of Neptune is Triton, and it is the seventh-largest
                    known moon of any planet. Some believe that the moon is actually a captured dwarf planet.</li>
                <li>Neptune’s color is believed to be influenced by the presence of methane in its atmosphere, but there
                    is also an unknown factor contributing to this.</li>
                <li>Neptune is the first planet to be discovered by the use of mathematical calculations and
                    predictions.</li>
                <li>Uranus is Neptune’s near twin in size and composition.</li>
                <li>Neptune has a powerful magnetic field. It is 27 times stronger than Earth’s.</li>
                <li>Neptune formed around 4.5 billion years ago however, many believe that it was closer to the Sun then
                    than now, but the planet started to drift away.</li>

            Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, and the fourth largest out of all the planets of the Solar
            System. It is more than 30 times farther from the Sun than Earth.<br>
            Though it is far, it is not the coldest planet, that title belongs to Uranus. However, Neptune is very cold,
            nonetheless. It is a dark and windy planet, having the most powerful winds in the Solar System.<br>
            The reason why Neptune is blue is due to the presence of a specific gas named methane. This is also why the
            planet Uranus is also blue. Both Uranus and Neptune are known as ice giants due to their compositions.<br>

            </div>
            The atmosphere of Neptune is made out of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The planet is basically a thick fog
            of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center.<br>
            Like other gas giants, Neptune has a ring system, six of them to be exact, but they are faint. Neptune also
            has 14 confirmed moons. The weather on Neptune is very active. Sometimes dark spots form in the atmosphere,
            which are basically storms the size of Earth.<br>
            It has the wildest and strangest weather out of all the planets in the Solar System. The winds speeds on
            Neptune are the most outstanding.<br>
            Some winds have been able to reach up to 2,160 km / 1.324 mi per hour. They are nearly a supersonic flow.
            These winds break the sound barrier being 5 times stronger than the strongest winds on Earth.<br>
